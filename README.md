# Working-with-Optimizers-and-Neural-Networks
Performance comparison of different optimizers SGD, Nestrov, Adam on different Convex and Non-Convex function such asRosenbrock, Baele and Ackley functions. Providing limitation of each optimizer and ways to improve performance.Binary Classification on "Vadapav" dataset (available on Kaggle) using pre-trained ResNet50 model.
